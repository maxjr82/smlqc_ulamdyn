This is a repository for a hands-on tutorial on unsupervised learning analysis of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) data 
generated by trajectory surface hopping simulations using the [Newton-X](https://newtonx.org/) software. The tutorial lecture 
was presented online in the [Seminars on **M**achine Learning in **Q**uantum Chemistry and **Q**uantum **C**omputing for Quantum 
Chemistry (SMLQC)](http://smlqc.mlatom.com/smlqc-seminars/). A Jupyter Notebook is provided in this repository with Python code 
to demonstrate the use of the ULaMDyn package in the automated unsupervised learning analysis (dimensionality reduction and 
clustering) of molecular dynamics data. The [Fulvene DC-FSSH](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14446998.v1) dataset 
generated from Newton-X simulations at the SA-2-CAS(6,6)/6-31G* theory level is used as a motivating example for the analyses 
presented in the tutorial.

## Topics covered in this tutorial 

- Molecular descriptors
  - Pairwise atom-atom distances
  - Gradient-based

- Dimensionality reduction
  - Isometric Feature Mapping (Isomap)

- Clustering analysis of molecular geometries
  - K-Means

## Requirements

The tutorial was designed to run in a jupyter notebook environment with

- python3 (tested with version 3.8.6)

The following libraries are necessary to run the tutorial:

- Specialized packages:

  - [ulamdyn](https://gitlab.com/maxjr82/ulamdyn)
  - py3Dmol

- Math and data processing:

  - pandas
  - numpy

- For visualization:

  - seaborn
  - matplotlib

The tutorial can be also executed on-line via [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github).
